## Contributing to TestMe IJ Plugin Project

Contributions are welcomed :)
Unless your intended contribution bares minor effort - it is highly recommended to post an issue/feature request first on the [project forum](http://weirddev.com/forum#!/testme) -
the changes you plan might not fit well with planned features on the project road map or with existing functionality, so it's better to start a debate and agree on the suggested changes.
We just don't want to waste your time and effort on a pull request that didn't get to be approved and merged into the project main branch :(

### Developing
Please add/update Unit Tests for new/updated functionality. Please adhere to commonly known Java development best practices and code styling standards (I have no idea what that means :) ) 


### Building

The Project is built with Gradle. Import build.gradle and run task - _runIdea_. The task is provided by [gradle-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin) project.  


### Contributor License Agreement

Please sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/wrdv/testme-idea). 
It can be signed now, or right after raising a Pull Request (Credits to [CLA-Assistant](https://github.com/cla-assistant/cla-assistant) for their cool, automated CLA form, linked from the pull request)
 
The CLA is a pretty standard non-exclusive license grant. If you have ever signed one before - you'll find it familiar.

*Thanks for contributing!*
